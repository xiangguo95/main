<p>I'm a PhD in the <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/">ECE department</a> at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>, supervised by <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/">Prof. Qi Zhu</a>. My research interests include optimization, control and learning theories as well as applications on connected and automated vehicle and cyber-physical systems.</p>
<p>Prior to Northwestern, I received my B.E. from department of control science and engineering from <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/">Zhejiang University</a>. I also visited the <a href="https://cee.engin.umich.edu/">Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> at <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a> and was pleased to work with <a href="https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/neda-masoud/">Prof. Neda Masoud</a>.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<b>Feel free to contact me for any comments on my research.</b>
